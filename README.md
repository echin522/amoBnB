# [AmoBnB](https://amobnb.herokuapp.com/#/)

AmoBnB is a full stack clone of [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/), an online marketplace for vacation rental homes and lodges. It allows users to create accounts and share (fake) listings of their homes as well as book reservations and write reviews for other homes. 

# Technologies

AmoBnB is built with a React/Redux frontend and a Ruby on Rails backend. All frontend styling was done with vanilla CSS and HTMLM. PostgreSQL was used in conjunction with AWS S3 (and the Active Storage Ruby Gem) for data and image storage respectively. The Google Maps API was used to give a visual of where each listing is geographically. The jQuery library was used to improve website responsiveness and simplify DOM traversal and create a much more dynamic UI/UX.
