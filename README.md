# [AmoBnB](https://amobnb.herokuapp.com/#/)

AmoBnB is a full stack clone of [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/), an online marketplace for vacation rental homes and lodges.

# Technologies

AmoBnB is built with a React/Redux frontend and a Ruby on Rails backend. All frontend styling was done with vanilla CSS and HTMLM. PostgreSQL was used in conjunction with AWS S3 (and the Active Storage Ruby Gem) for data and image storage respectively. Used the Google Maps API for rendering maps and listing markers. The jQuery library was used to improve website responsiveness and simplify DOM traversal and create a much more dynamic UI/UX.
